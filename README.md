# Employees_MVC
The application was written in Visual Studio 2017 Community. 

In order to use the application please follow steps:
1. Download Unzip the file Employees_MVC.zip
2. Enter the unziped folder Employees_MVC
3. Run Employees_MVC.sln
4. Press F5 to initialize code

At the moment the application doean't meet 
all requriemnts but I hope I would be able to fix it one day.

Thank You for Your time

Best Regards
